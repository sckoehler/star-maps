# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts go generated the README.md diagrams
and also h400_maps.pdf.  The scripts use base shell, perl, pdflatex, and
Inkscape. Mostly, these are for my use.

`gen_diagrams` generates the two diagrams in `images` directory.

`h400_maps.pdf` is generated by running `gen_h400_maps`, `maps2pdf`, and `pdflatex h400_maps.tex`, in order.
