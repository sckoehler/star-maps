# star-maps

Genmap is a script written in Ruby to generate simple star maps in
scalar vector graphics (SVG) format.  My original intent was to
generate diagrams showing the location of the Herschel 400 objects on
the Sky Atlas 2000 maps, something like the following:

After discovering Diego Hernangomez's excellent repository of
[celestial data](https://dieghernan.github.io/celestial_data/data) in
geojson format, I expanded the tool to add more and more information
layers.  The end result looks like this:
